        <h2>A message from me about the game itself and my favorite moments from it: </h2>
        <h3>A "review": </h3>
        <p>I really liked that game when I just started playing it, it was really fun at first, 
            I really like the movement in that game and how dynamic and fast-paced it is (probably the best shooter in these categories imo).
        </p>
        <p>But after a certain season the game started to kinda falling apart. 
            They removed a very good a fast gamemode called arenas, added a lot of shitty micro-transaction items, that devalued previous items, that people worked hard to get them.
        </p>
        <h3>My favorite moment of all time: </h3>
        <p>Probably one of my favorite moments in this game is when I won a game with my friend, got a new level and a lootbox chest for it, opened it and got 2 Heirlooms in a row (basically chance of getting 2 in a row is: 1/25000).</p>
