        <h2>A message from me about the game itself and my favorite moments from it: </h2>
        <h3>A "review": </h3>
        <p>So, as I said in the start: game has <strong>HUGE</strong> room for skill improvement, with many different skill-sets inside the game, many different maps and the mapping itself is a skill on itself. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile the community mostly cool, there's a chance to meet some really weird people (osu! Drama Days Twitter account is for a reason there lol). </p>
        <p>While improving your own skill is important for some people, it most sertainly not for others, and for these people you can still play with no issues and just having fun in multiplayer lobbies or solo mode.</p>
        <h3>My favorite moment of all time: </h3>
        <p>There's a few scores that I'm really proud of, but if I need to pick one that's probably gonna be SS on a 7* FAITH map (my first 7* FC actually lol).</p>
        <h2>Some of my highlights: </h2>
