        <h2>About the game: </h2>
        <p>This is a tactical shooter, much slower paced that Apex, but still could be pretty fun to play (if you mute voice chat tho).</p>

        <h2>A message from me about the game itself and my favorite moments from it: </h2>
        <h3>A "review": </h3>
        <p>This game is fun to play <em>if</em> you have friends to play with (at least 3). 
            Because playing with randoms in that game is borderline impossible.
        </p>
        <h3>My favorite moment of all time: </h3>
        <p>There's a lot of pog moments that I had, so can't really pick one.</p>
        <h2>Some of my highlights: </h2>
        <em>I'll put videos here later</em>
